# Labyrinthe 3D (labyrinthe-3d)

Small Android game built with React Native by the Android game factory. Package: `io.github.nhilaire.labyrinthe3d`.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Languages**: code, comments, commits, README and docs in English. Everything the player sees exists in **French
  and English** (`src/i18n/fr.ts` is the reference, `en.ts` the translation, never inline in components; read them with
  `useI18n()`). French typography: non-breaking space before `: ; ! ?`; English: none.
- **No secrets, no personal data in git.** `firebase/google-services.json`, keystores, `.env`, APKs stay local.
  Never write a real name, email, phone number or local user path in code, docs, screenshots or logs.
  The pre-commit and pre-push hooks run `scripts/secret-scan.mjs`; never bypass them (`--no-verify` is forbidden).
- **Telemetry is opt-in** (GDPR/CNIL). Nothing is sent before the player accepts on the consent screen.
  Only events from `src/telemetry/events.ts`, with numeric/boolean/short enum params. No identifiers, no free text.
- **Prove it works.** A change is done when its proof exists: unit test, Maestro flow, or evidence report.
  "It should work" is not a proof.
- **Final app name** = `displayName` in `factory-app.json` (single source). Project slug `labyrinthe-3d` is only the repo/folder name.

## Layout

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `src/game/` | Pure TypeScript game logic (no React): state, rules, scoring. 100% unit-tested. |
| `src/screens/`, `src/ui/` | React components. No game rules here. |
| `src/telemetry/` | Consent, typed event catalog, Firebase wrapper (no-op if Firebase is absent). |
| `src/i18n/` | Player-facing text per language (`fr.ts` reference, `en.ts`), language resolution and provider. |
| `.maestro/` | E2E flows run on the emulator; screenshots become evidence. |
| `docs/` | BRIEF, PRD, ADRs, PLAN, KPIS, evidence per version. |

## Commands

```bash
npm test               # Jest unit + component tests
npm run typecheck      # TypeScript, no emit
node scripts/secret-scan.mjs --worktree   # secrets / PII scan of the working tree
```

Build, install and verification are driven from the factory (`verify-app`, `release-apk` skills).
